# Pubular
Pubular started as an idea, to solve the issue of "Where should we go tonight?" from this, I developed a multi-platform hybrid mobile and web application named Pubular using HTML/CSS/JS/AJAX and PhoneGap

Pubular allows its users to visualise the most popular venues in the city in real-time using GPS tracking in the data format of a heat map. In other words, every user that signed in added their GPS location to the map, resulting in a heat map that accurately depicted the popularity of pubs and clubs.

This required the knowledge of JavaScript and additional frameworks with the creation of a local and remote server, the process helped me better understand the methodology behind programming languages like Python, Java, Node and Databases. I thoroughly enjoyed the vast array of technical problem solving and difficulties the project entailed. I learned an extensive range of new abilities that magnified my confidence immensely, from thinking up innovative ways to create a user-centered design to expanding my growing knowledge of programming languages.
